    <h2>Who was Ada Lovelace?</h2>
    <p>Ada lovelace is known as the pioneer of computing scientist and the first programmer - in the 1800s. She worked with Charles Babbage, another mathmatician, to create the ideas for a computer. However, she was the one who discovered that a computer could do way more than just calculating.</p>

        <h2>December 10, 1815</h2>
        <p>Ada Lovelace was born in London, England as Augusta Ada Bryon. Her father was Lord Bryon, a poet. Her mother was Anne Isabella Milbanke. She was highly educated and enthusiastic about mathmatics and science. <br>Image: Ada Lovelace</p>

        <h2>Her Education</h2>
        <p>Ada's father's personality was notoriously unstable. Her mother did not want Ada to become like that, so she insisted she would get a high quality education on mathmatics and science, and stay away from subjects like poetry. Ada also learned music and french. Her mother was very strict, since she wanted Ada to become a diciplined person, unlike her father. <br> Image: Lady Bryon</p>

        <h2>June 5, 1833</h2>
        <p>At age17, she met a mathmatician named Charles Babbage. He showed Ada and Lady Bryon a model he was making of a calculating machiene. He was fed up with people making mistakes, so he wanted to make a hand-cranked or steam-driven machiene that would make calculations. She was astonished by the concept and asked what she could do to help. That same month, she met Mary Somerville, who was one of the best female mathmaticians. In 1835, she married William King, who became the Earl of Lovelace 3 years later.<br>Image: Ada Lovelace's notes</p>

        <h2>Her Contributions</h2>
        <p>She was later asked to translate an article about Charles Babbage's work from French to English. Babbage also mentioned that she could also add her own notes since she was more than capable to doing so. The notes ended up being 3 times longer than the actual article. In there, she included some things that were essential to coding today, like the ability to process not only numbers but also letters. Also, she invented looping. Looping is when a computer repeats set instructions over and over again, which is how computers run today. She wrote so many things that were utilized in today's computing, so she is known to be the first computer programmer. <br>Image: Charles Babbage's analytical engine.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Ada Lovelace always had some health problems. She had asthma and digestive issues, and caught cholera in 1837.  She died of cancer in 1852. Her work was not discovered until the 1950s, when B.V. Bowden, when he republished it in his book. After that, she became praised and gotten several honors for her work. The U.S department of defense also created a programming language called Ada, which was named after her, and is still used today. <br>Image: Ada Programming Language</p>
